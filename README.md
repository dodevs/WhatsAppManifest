#### Usage

##### 1. Import library
```python
from WhatsAppManifest import ADB, Automator
```

##### 2. Start Server
```python
# Local ADB
with ADB(use_ssh=False) as AdbServer:
    automator = Automator(adb_server=AdbServer, adb_host="127.0.0.1", adb_port=5037)

# Remote ADB
with ADB(use_ssh=True,
         ssh_ip="<SSH-IP>",
         ssh_port=22,
         ssh_username="<SSH-USERNAME>",
         ssh_password="<SSH-PASSWORD>",
         remote_bind_ip="127.0.0.1",  # ADB SERVER INTERNAL IP
         remote_bind_port=5037  # ADB SERVER PORT
         ) as AdbServer:

    automator = Automator(adb_server=AdbServer, adb_host="127.0.0.1", adb_port=5037)
```
##### 3. List devices
```python
for device in automator.list_devices(state=None):
    print(device.serial)

# You can instantiate an instance using your serial, if you don't want to list.
device = automator.get_device(serial="XXXXXXX")
```

##### 4. Hello World
```python
from WhatsAppManifest.automator.whatsapp import Conversation
conversation = Conversation(device=device)
phone = "+0011987654321"
jid = conversation.phone_str_to_jid(phone=phone)
created = conversation.chat_exists(jid=jid)
        
if not created:
    created = conversation.create_chat(phone_number=phone)

if created:
    conversation.send_message(
            jid=jid,
            message="Hello World!",
            re_open=True, # This causes WhatsApp to close and then open again, to avoid bugs.
            wait_send_complete=True # This makes the Script only continue after the last message sent to the contact has arrived at the server or the contact.
			)
```

##### 5. Send media
```python
from WhatsAppManifest.automator.whatsapp import Conversation
conversation = Conversation(device=device)
phone = "+0011987654321"
jid = conversation.phone_str_to_jid(phone=phone)
created = conversation.chat_exists(jid=jid)
        
if not created:
    created = conversation.create_chat(phone_number=phone)

if created:
    conversation.send_media(
            jid=jid,
            file_path=r"/to/folder/file",
            re_open=True, # This causes WhatsApp to close and then open again, to avoid bugs.
            wait_send_complete=True # This makes the Script only continue after the last message sent to the contact has arrived at the server or the contact.
			)
```

##### 6. Tools
```python
help(device.ui_automator)
help(device.adb_device)
help(device.adb_utils)
```
#### Attention
I'm still fixing some problems and making new features available, don't expect frequent updates because I'm using this code for learning.
I promise to improve the documentation in a few days, until then, I recommend using the examples I left in [/examples](examples "/examples").

#### Capabilities
- Send messages
- Change profile information
- Change profile photo
- Change status
- Read messages
- Get contact list
- Get list of groups
- Get all events for a given conversation

**Attention**: Part of these features are possible thanks to the possibility of manipulating the application's database, however I do not recommend that you make any changes to it, until then I only used the same for "SELECT", be careful.

#### Next steps:
- Improve documentation and facilitate access to all features, since most of them still have a little complex use
- Enable the download of files (or obtaining those already downloaded locally).

#### Disadvantages
- Unfortunately it is not possible (or I still don't know how) to create trigger events, for example "when receiving a message activate a certain function".
- For a good flow, we almost always need to close the application and then open it again on the screen we want.
- It is necessary to use more computer resources than when using the browser, for example
